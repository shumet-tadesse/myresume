-Harnessing Artificial Intelligence for Equitable Education Access: A Socially Inclusive Framework
-Abstract
  <p> This PhD research aims to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to address educational disparities and promote social inclusion. Focusing on underprivileged communities, the study will design and implement an AI-driven framework that tailors educational interventions based on individual learning needs. By harnessing the power of machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, and adaptive learning systems, the research seeks to create personalized educational pathways, considering socio-economic factors, cultural diversity, and individual capabilities. The overarching goal is to enhance accessibility to quality education for marginalized populations, contributing to the broader initiative of using AI for social good. The study will involve collaboration with educational institutions, policymakers, and community stakeholders to ensure the ethical deployment of AI technologies and the creation of a sustainable and inclusive learning environment. </p>
